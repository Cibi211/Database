# Face Dataset Collection Using OpenCV

This project captures face images using OpenCV and stores them in a dataset for further training, such as face recognition. It detects a face from the webcam, extracts the facial region, resizes it, and saves it as an image file.

## Features

->Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) for face detection.

->Captures and stores 60 face images in a dataset.

->Saves images in a structured directory (datasets/{person_name}).

->Converts frames to grayscale for better accuracy.

->Press Esc to stop the process manually.
